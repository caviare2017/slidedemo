## basic information

```
Name:Yang Zhengji
From:College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering(CCME)
Gender:curious、enthusiastic……
More detailed information:
    Umm,it seems that there's no need to duplicate above-motions.So let's talk
about something else.  ^0^(
    As for this lesson,I haven't used Pathon before.And in fact, I have never 
learnt programming before.But I think it as a quite intresting and challenging 
thing, in which can I learn a lot and have much fun.What's more,progamming 
techniques is developing into a basic skill in many areas,especially in base 
disciplines.It will be of great importance!
    And the last paragraph is about why I don't talk about some other aspects of
myself.Very clearly(滑稽滑稽),I have "hobby&speciality"to be my section 2.Or else
I can't find proper content to fill in it.
